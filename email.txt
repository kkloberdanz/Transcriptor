Hi Kyle,

Thank you for taking the time to chat with a few members of the team.

Everyone has enjoyed their conversation with you and we are excited to move forward with you into the next stage in the process.

We'd like to invite you to a 90-minute panel interview over video chat with the team. **Please note that this interview will be recorded for the team. If you do not wish to be recorded or if there are any issues, please contact us to let us know.**

For this interview, please come prepared with an NLP or ASR model of your choice (e.g., text summarization, topic detection, gender detection), ready for inference on a few exemplar files, such as the following:

http://static.deepgram.com/examples/epi.wav

The model can be off-the-shelf and pre-trained, or something you trained yourself. You may interface with the model and data in any language of your choice. Additionally, please familiarize yourself with an HTTP server framework of your choice.

Please let me know your availability for this week and next week in Pacific time.

Once I receive your availability, I will work with the team to schedule and confirm your interview.

If you need anything at all, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Respectfully,
Steven
